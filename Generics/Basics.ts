// How to call?

/**
 * The first way is to pass all of the arguments, including the type argument, to the function:
 */
greet2<string>("Hello");

/**
 *The second way is also perhaps the most common. Here we use type argument inference â€“ 
that is, we want the compiler to set the value of T for us automatically based on the type of the argument we pass in: 
 */

greet2("Hello");
